          Hello, I'm Tanya Jackson.

          With a keen eye for design and a heart full of creativity, I specialize in curating custom home decor that reflects your personality, values, and lifestyle. Whether it's a cozy living room, a chic bedroom, or a statement-making entryway, I bring a unique, culturally-inspired perspective to every project.
          
          My journey into home decorating started as a passion for creating inviting, comfortable spaces for myself and my loved ones. Over time, that passion turned into a business where I get to help others reimagine their homes and make their spaces reflect who they truly are. I take pride in using bold colors, textures, and unique patterns, creating environments that feel personal, timeless, and full of life.
          
          I'm not just about making spaces look beautiful – I’m committed to making them feel like home. I work closely with every client to understand their vision, offering personalized, hands-on design solutions that elevate their everyday living. Every room I design is a reflection of the people who inhabit it – full of warmth, joy, and individuality.
          
          When I'm not working on a new design project, you can find me gathering inspiration from my travels, spending time with family, or diving into the rich history of design within the Black community. My mission is simple: to help you create a space that you love, that’s true to you, and that makes you feel right at home.
          
          Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to helping you make your house a place that truly feels like home.</p>
